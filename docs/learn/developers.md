## Developer in Fleek Network - Current State

As a developer, you will be able to build or use services running on Fleek Network's decentralized edge infrastructure.

This will be possible **after our initial Testnet rollouts in August, and after we publish our Service Development Kit (SDK) for service development**. Currently, we are finalizing the core developments of the protocol and setting the foundations for the testnet release.
