## Node whitelist verification

Important: This guides are valid during an active testnet phase. You might find it useful to run the following command to verify the status of the node whitelist statusâ€“since a node throws an error if not whitelisted, this can be verified by looking at and monitoring the `diagnostic.log` file manually, otherwise, use the method shared here.

1) Connect to the server terminal where the node is installed

2) Switch to the user account that was used to set up the node as recommended in the [installation guide](/docs/node/install#create-a-user)

3) Execute the following command

```sh
curl -sS https://get.fleek.network/whitelist | bash
```

:::tip
The node whitelist verification will verify the logs output to determine if the node has the "node whitelist" error. You can verify this manually by observing the `diagnostic.log`. To learn how to check the `logs`, read the section [analyzing log messages](/docs/node/install#analyzing-log-messages).
:::

:::warning
We are going to be whitlisting in waves at the beginning of every epoch. Epochs are currently 30 mins (as for this period of testnet). If you have [updated the binary](/references/Lightning%20CLI/update-cli-from-source-code), run the node that you applied with. While your not whitelisted your node will be checking every 5 minutes and will start when whitelisted.
