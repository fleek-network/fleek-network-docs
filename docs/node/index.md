## Overview

This section provides instructions to help you build a **Fleek Network Node**, it's aimed at everybody willing to learn and cultivate knowledge as a [node operator](#node-operator).

:::tip
To participate in the [alpha Testnet](/docs/roadmap), you can begin by setting up and running nodes. Check the [requirements](/docs/node/requirements) and find the [onboarding instructions](/docs/node/testnet-onboarding) to enable you to [install](/docs/node/install) a network node successfully.

# Node operator
---

A **Node Operator** is represented as a system administrator who builds, installs or maintains one or many nodes in a server or more.

Anyone willing to learn can become a Node operator, which will be enabled to set up and run a Node on their own at any time without the need for anyone's permission.

Amongst others, the use cases we try to cover are:

- Server requirements
- Installing the Node easily with the installation wizard
- Building a Node binary from source code
- Configuring the Node
- Securing the server and identity
- Updating the Node
- Learning to troubleshoot
- Learning how to analyze the node process log messages

:::tip
While we do our best to provide the clearest instructions, there's always space for improvement, therefore feel free to make any contributions by messaging us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fleekxyz) or by opening a PR in any of our repositories.
