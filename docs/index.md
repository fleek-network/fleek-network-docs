## About Fleek Network

Fleek Network is an open-source Edge Computing Platform to accelerate the development and execution of decentralized Web Services.

Fleek Network is a platform for Apps, Protocols and Service builders looking to achieve decentralization without sacrificing cost and user experience — a robust solution for a broad range of use cases, including Content Delivery and Serverless functions.

The system builds on a distributed network of Nodes, where services run within a fair and incentivized ecosystem constituted by an open community of developers and operators who hold and control their private identities.

You can run a Node or build a Service without permission. Alternatively, become a client for any of the supported services.
