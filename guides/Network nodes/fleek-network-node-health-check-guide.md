## Introduction

In Software development, a health check means checking the health status of a resource to determine whether the resource is operating correctly.

The purpose of the guide is to provide basic information about the node resource by explaining the host, port numbers, logs during runtime, etc for Fleek Network.

You should have followed our [getting started guide](#fleek-network-getting-started-guide) and have the Ursa CLI installed in the machine terminal you're accessing to follow along.

We'll give you a basic introduction to the topic, but you should also appreciate the fact that development is ongoing, and other factors, such as the introduction of features that may cause malfunction of a node beyond what a simple health check can hint about the network.

For any unexpected behavior, we appreciate the contribution of the community by any means which includes reporting to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fleekxyz), opening a [PR](https://github.com/fleek-network), reporting issues in our [Github repository](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/issues), etc.

## Pre-requisites

To follow the guide, you will need the following:

- Familiarity with the command-line interface

## What's a node health check?

A Node health check is exactly what it sounds like, a way of checking the health status of a Fleek Network node!

A Node operator can do a health check (as it's common among system operators worth their title) to get feedback and see if the resource is working! It's a good practice for a Node operator to do it frequently, as otherwise there'd be no way of knowing whether or not the Node is running. For example, some advanced operators automate this process by using cronjobs and getting reports via email, etc.

Health checks are valuable and a must for all the Node operators, as they are incentivized to participate in the network by making their resources available which the reward mechanism evaluates.

Rewards are only a given for good behavior and thus an unhealthy Node or bad management can cause disappointment. A decentralized and permissionless network, which is beyond anyone's control (us included) requires some education by the users.

A system can be highly customizable and understanding some basics can help you achieve success as a node operator, resource health checking is important! There are many reasons why'd want to learn how to operate, such as the "how to do node health checks" we instruct here.

Fleek Network depends on the Node operator's success, thus we try to keep things simple and try to motivate you to learn for the network's overall health! That's what a Node health check is about, your contribution!

## Resource monitoring

The Fleek Network Node is initialized by running the `Ursa CLI` which creates a process in the operating system, this process responds to requests over an inter-communication mechanism we denominate as the Fleek Network - Fleek's DCDN (Decentralized Content Delivery Network). 

We can call the Fleek Network Node a service, meaning that the Node is a sort of application that runs as a service on a server, or in the practical sense, the `Ursa CLI` initializes a Node as a client version used to access the main service provider, the Fleek Network, composed by any number of these Nodes!

As Fleek Network is used by getting and serving content, the Node responds as a resource in the system, thus providing a certain level of detail to the end-user, for our guide use case, the Node operator. Running Nodes write to the stdout (standard output stream) well-defined log messages, some more human-friendly than others.

[Log messages](#log-messages) are well formatted, with an identifier describing the type: Warning, Error, etc.

As `Ursa CLI` is in constant development, at the current development stage the output from the Node should be super verbose.

This is to help the development team get feedback. You might see `logs` of the types: Debug, Trace, etc; which for a non-developer human, can cause the feeling of reading the most dreadful poetry in literature, as it'd only spark joy to help troubleshoot or make development decisions. As in any book title and book content, feel free to ignore it but don't judge the book by its cover!

### Processes

We recommend running the Stack (for docker-compose users), which provides a proxy, HTTPS, monitoring and analytics capability to your server that is running the Node. You can find instructions on how to run the `Stack` [here](#fleek-network-running-a-node-in-a-docker-container)!

💡 The `Ursa` Node can run on its own without any of the dependencies suggested in the `Stack`, but we'll use the `Stack` to describe a common use-case scenario or some of the common practices you'd find among Node operator and system administrators setups. You can customize and monitor `Ursa` Node on your own, if you prefer, you can then skip to [ports](#ports).

The Stack has the following services:
  - Node - we call `Ursa` the living process that we refer to as Node, this is started via the `Ursa CLI` (`ports 4069, 6009, 8070`)
  - Reverse proxy - we have `ursa-proxy` as a reverse proxy for `Ursa` Node service where we have configured the public port 80, SSL certification, a server name, etc. Port 80 maps to the `4069` internally, as to provide a secure connection over HTTP. Previously, Nginx was used as the reverse proxy. If you have Nginx, you're advised to update your Node setup
  - Process monitoring - a monitoring system for real-time metrics with a web client (`port 9090`) that exposes metrics of the reverse proxy (`port 9113`) and the actual Node metrics (`port 4069`)
  - Metric visualization - for visualizing metrics, logs, and traces collected from the `Ursa` Node we have Grafana (`port 3000`)

The `Stack` is our recommendation but we only provide support for `Ursa CLI`. Thus, support for `Grafana`, or `Prometheus` is on the operator side.

### Log messages

Log messages are well formatted and have an associated type, as described in the [processes](#processes).

- ERROR - The `error` designates very serious errors.
- WARN - The `warning` designates hazardous situations.
- INFO - The `info` designates useful information.
- DEBUG - The `debug` designates lower-priority information.
- TRACE - The `trace` designates very low-priority, often extremely verbose, information.

Depending on development time, some Log message types might be present in your output that offer very low-priority information but that can be of good use for the development team, e.g. the `debug` and `trace` are good examples. 

🙏 We understand this can be quite intimidating at the time - some people ask "Is it ok?", a few "Is my Node working?", other's "Is it working?", in general you shouldn't bother much about warning messages as those are expected through development. In any case, we expect to reduce the verbosity of the output as soon as possible!

Here's an example, yours might differ a bit:

### Host

When Ursa Node is initialized, the address which is bound to be the `0.0.0.0``, meaning that the service is listening to all the host-configured network interfaces, such as `127.0.0.1`.

Any traffic sent to an addressable interface that hits the correct endpoint or port number should have a response by the Node. Of course, bear in mind that your system should not have any form of firewall or blockers configured!

### Ports

A Fleek Network Node, or the process we refer to as Node has bound to `0.0.0.0` and has a port exposed to the host, port 6009 and in the Stack's network, port 4069.

⚠️ If you have choose to install natively the ports 4069 and 6009 are bound to the host. Otherwise, if you've installed the recommended Docker stack the port 4069 is not exposed to the host (you cannot communicate with port 4069 from your host, you'd have to run in the docker stack network).

Below, we explain what these are used for:

- Port `4069` (TCP), used for HTTP RPC, RPC, REST and metrics
- Port `6009` (TCP/UDP), used by the P2P protocol running in the network

💡 To communicate, the Node uses TCP and UDP (retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP, for example, when we download a file from the internet through our browsers we expect a complete file, no bits should be missing, TCP ensures that the data is received correctly, data is not missing and is in order).

As described in the [processes](#processes), the ports should be available in the host for other services to operate! Make sure you don't have blockers, such as Firewall, or forget to expose them in Docker or on your custom setup! Open up your firewall, and if needed do a port-forward if docker doesn't do that for you.

⚠️ Remember, the Node won't be able to respond if the ports are blocked. This might be quite difficult to troubleshoot, so make sure you have control over your system permissions to guarantee a successful node operation.

## How to do a check-up?

You should have completed the topics above to understand what and why the endpoints are available. We expect you to know, that the system should not have a firewall or any blockers on the required ports in either Docker or other custom setups. If you ignore this, your Node will malfunction and cause disappointment. Fleek Network is decentralized and permissionless, it's your responsibility to fully understand the basics, at the very least, to have a Node running successfully! The guides are your friends!

We're going to use [cURL](https://curl.se/), make sure that you have it installed otherwise install it in your operating system.

In any case, you should have the Node running to be able to follow the steps. We'll use the Docker compose Stack version but if you have a custom setup in a server or host you'll be able to follow.

For the ones who followed the [getting started guide](#fleek-network-getting-started-guide), the following request should be familiar.

We execute a `cURL` request with the `--head` or `-I` flag to show the document info only, in our case the headers of our HTTP response.

```sh
curl -w "\n" 127.0.0.1/ping
```

💡 If you have used the [Assisted installer](./how-to-install-a-node-easily-with-the-assisted-installer), you'll find that a health check can be performed to your secured domain name, learn how [here](#health-check-my-secured-domain).

The response should be:

```sh
pong
```

💡 As mentioned, we are interacting with the Stack, thus we interact with port 80 which our reverse proxy maps to the internal port 4069. Of course, you can test any port but the port that should be publicly available is going to be port 80. Learn how to run a stack [here](../Network%20nodes/fleek-network-running-a-node-in-a-docker-container#run-the-container-from-the-recommended-stack) and [How to secure a Network Node](../Network%20nodes/fleek-network-securing-a-node-with-ssl-tls) to find out more about how to secure external communications internally.

You can also check the headers of the response:

```sh
curl -I 127.0.0.1/ping
```

Which response is:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
content-length: 4
date: Thu, 20 Apr 2023 09:59:34 GMT
```

The service listens in different [ports](#ports), for example, we can check the name of the process listening in port 6009 by:

```sh
lsof -i :6009
```

In the response, we can identify the COMMAND name `ursa` and other details. A long continuous response is expected because port `6009` is used by the P2P (peer-to-peer) protocol running in the network (press ctrl+c to interrupt it).

```sh
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
ursa    164985 root   15u  IPv4 1012942      0t0  TCP ubuntu-s-8vcpu-16gb-intel-lon1-01:6009->95.214.54.56:6009 (ESTABLISHED)
ursa    164985 root   16u  IPv4 3122608      0t0  TCP ubuntu-s-8vcpu-16gb-intel-lon1-01:6009->vmi1146262.contaboserver.net:6009 (ESTABLISHED)
ursa    164985 root   17u  IPv4  957309      0t0  TCP *:6009 (LISTEN)
ursa    164985 root   35u  IPv4  972232      0t0  TCP ubuntu-s-8vcpu-16gb-intel-lon1-01:6009->vmi1275896.contaboserver.net:8614 (ESTABLISHED)
ursa    164985 root   40u  IPv4 1599455      0t0  TCP ubuntu-s-8vcpu-16gb-intel-lon1-01:6009->43.156.110.73:6009 (ESTABLISHED)
```

For our use case, we can take this as `ursa` Fleen Network Node listening in port `6009`. We can do the same for the port `4069` that's used for HTTP RPC, REST, and metrics, which operate via HTTP, as such a Http Header is expected which is not the case for `6009` and thus we do a different mode of verification instead of `curl` `/ping`.

You can determine failure if the `ursa` process is not showing the expected listening ports as described in [ports](#ports).

If you're running the `Stack` (docker-compose), then a service like `Prometheus` (`port 9090`) or `Grafana` (`port 3000`) could also be checked!

As an example, since `Prometheus` provides a dashboard you can expect some HTML in the response:

```sh
curl -I 127.0.0.1:9090
```

Response is:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET, OPTIONS
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Date: Wed, 04 Jan 2023 19:28:04 GMT
Content-Length: 19
```

💡 You can open `http://localhost:9090` to access the `Prometheus` dashboard, and if you'd like to open it from any location outside your network, you need a bit of work in the server setup, the same for any of the endpoints or ports described in this guide. Checking the `Stack` (docker-compose) can give you an idea of how that'd look in terms of configuration or where to find the configuration file of those services, for example, the [full-node](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/cd6fb3d21ce647dc3f06ee9128ba2a4164623ee5/docker/full-node/docker-compose.yml) can be used as a reference.

## Health-check my secured domain?

A Health-check can be done to your secured server via HTTPS. If you have completed the installation with the Assisted Installer, you can run the following command from any remote location that has access to the internet;

```sh
curl -w "\n" https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/ping
```

You'll get the response back `pong`

```sh
pong
```

If you'd like to have a prettier response use:

```sh
curl -s https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/ping | grep -q 'pong' && echo "✅ Health check is ok!"
```

You should get back the response:

```sh
✅ Health check is ok!
```

## Conclusion

We started by going through [What a node Health Check](#whats-a-node-health-check) means and looked into [Resource monitoring](#resource-monitoring) and the parts the resource provides, such as [Log messages](#log-messages), [Processes](#processes), [Host](#host), [Ports](#ports), with some warnings along the way about firewalls.

To complete this, we demonstrated how to use `cURL` to do a simple health check to verify if the endpoints or ports are in use by expecting particular responses. We found out about at least one different request which is closed immediately, as it's not an HTTP/S request and provided some hints or some thoughts on how to leverage this information.

Finally, we hinted that exposing services externally requires a bit more setup, and the Docker compose file can be used as a reference to get you started.
