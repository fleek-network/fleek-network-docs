:::tip
Although the step-by-step instructions described here are simple to follow, this steps are available as an automated script.

To use the automated script execute the following command in your server terminal, select **Node Update** from the **Tools** menu option and follow the instructions:

```sh
curl -sS https://get.fleek.network | bash
```
:::

<WarningPreventPrematureShutdown />

<TipShutdownGracefully />

## Switch to the installation user

Switch to the username you've used throughout the installation process.

```sh
su <USERNAME>
```

For example, if you used the username `lgtn` it'll look like the following command:

```sh
su lgtn
```

## Change directory to the source code

If you have installed it via the recommended process or instructions, then the default location where the [source code](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning) is stored is `~/fleek-network/lightning`.

```sh
cd ~/fleek-network/lightning
```

:::tip
Notice that we use `~`, which refers to `$HOME`. You must use the username used for the installation process. For example, on [Ubuntu](/docs/node/requirements#server) if you use the username `lgtn`, the pathname for `$HOME` is `/home/lgtn`.
:::

## Checkout to branch

Make sure that you are checked in to the correct branch. For the current testnet phase that'd be `testnet-alpha-1`. If you use any other branch name, your node will not function correctly. Use the branch name `testnet-alpha-1`.

```sh
git checkout testnet-alpha-1
```

:::tip
We try to update our documentation promptly but sometimes are a bit behind on any changes we might make in real-time. If you find any typos, such as the wrong branch name, help us by letting us know! Find us in Fleek Network section of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fleek).
:::

## Pull the latest changes

Before make sure that you stash or clear any changes you may have in the working directory, as otherwise, `git` will let you know about local changesâ€“if you'd like to learn more about it read the [git stash document](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash).

A quick way to clean is to `stash` the changes, for example:

```sh
git stash
```

:::tip
After upgrading, don't forget your stash.
You will have access to your stashed changes with
```sh
git stash list
git diff stash
```

You can also drop it if nothing is usefull
```sh
git stash drop
```
:::

To pull the latest changes use the `git pull` command, as follows:

```sh
git pull origin testnet-alpha-1
```

Alternatively, to have to stash and pull, you can reset the repository to the origin.

```sh
git fetch origin testnet-alpha-1
git reset --hard origin/testnet-alpha-1
git clean -f
```

:::tip
We are using the branch named `testnet-alpha-1`, which is specific to the early testnet launch. Change to the correct branch name according to needs. For example, in the future the mainnet version will go on branch name `main`.
:::

## Build binary from the source

To build the binary from the source code, we execute the cargo build command:

```sh
cargo +stable install --locked --path core/cli --features services
```

:::tip
The command uses the stable rust toolchain, if the command fails you have to install it, run the following commands:

```sh
rustup toolchain install stable
```

Optionally, set stable as default toolchain as follows:

```sh
 rustup default stable
```
:::

## Update the symlink

Create or overwrite a symlink that links the new built binary to `/usr/local/bin/lgtn`, as follows:

```sh
sudo ln -sfv ~/fleek-network/lightning/target/release/lightning-node /usr/local/bin/lgtn
```

## Set user path in config.toml

<SetUserPathInConfigToml />

## Update the systemd service unit

Open and edit the `/etc/systemd/system/lightning.service` file.


1) Replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with the username. For example, in the [documentation](/docs/node/install#create-a-user) we use the username `lgtn`.

2) Make sure that the `ExecStart` is set correctly

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Fleek Network Node lightning service

[Service]
Type=simple
MemoryHigh=32G
RestartSec=15s
Restart=always
ExecStart=lgtn -c /home/<YOUR-USERNAME>/.lightning/config.toml -vv run
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/lightning/output.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/lightning/diagnostic.log
Environment=TMPDIR=/var/tmp

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<NoteExecStartFlagCConfigPath />

When complete make sure the file is saved. Followed by a systemctl daemon reload:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Clear the data

```sh
rm -rf ~/.lightning/data
```

Depending on how you control the system, this might need **sudo**.

```sh
sudo rm -rf ~/.lightning/data
```

## Update the `config.toml`

Remove the `~/.lightning/config.toml`.

```sh
rm ~/.lightning/config.toml
```

Create a new `config.toml`

```sh
lgtn print-config --default > ~/.lightning/config.toml
```

## Update the `config.toml` with user home path

<FindAndReplaceConfigWithUserPaths />

## Restart the service

Once the cargo build process is completed, you have to restart the service. We're assuming you are using non-root user as [recommended](/docs/node/install#create-a-user), you won't use **sudo** to start the service. The command will look as follows:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart lightning
```

:::tip
If you have installed the Fleek Network lightning manually, the [installation instructions](/docs/node/install#systemd-service-setup) recommended setting up a systemd service for the Fleek Network process. If you haven't, you're advised to check the instructions provided.
:::

## Health checkup

Do a quick health check by running:

```sh
curl -w "\p" localhost:4230/health
```

If successful, you should get the response `running and staked`, as follows:

```sh
running and staked
```
