import GitCloneOptions from '../../guides/partials/_git-clone-options.mdx';

## Clone the source code locally

<GitCloneOptions />

## Change directory to Lightning source code

```sh
cd ~/fleek-network/lightning
```

## Install Docker

:::tip
We're using Ubuntu Linux. You'll have to make the required tweaks for your preferred Linux Distro. Find the list of support operating systems [here](/docs/node/requirements#server).
:::

```sh
sudo apt update
```

Next, install the required packages to let apt use packages over HTTPS:

```sh
sudo apt install \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  software-properties-common
```

Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add the Docker repository to apt sources and update the package database with the Docker packages from the new added repository:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu jammy stable"
```

Set to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:

```sh
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

Finally, install Docker:

```sh
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

Once complete you should be able to run it via the CLI, as such:

```sh
docker -v
```

Here's the output (versions might differ a bit from the time of writing):

```sh
Docker version 24.0.6, build ed223bc
```

## Docker setup verification

The following command's output will indicate if Docker's working correctly:

```sh
sudo docker run hello-world
```

You should get a "Hello from Docker!".

## Check the Dockerfile

You should have [changed directory](#change-directory-to-lightning-source-code) to the projecto directory.

If you run a `cat Dockerfile`, you should have content similar to:

```sh
FROM rust:latest as builder
ARG PROFILE=release
WORKDIR /lightning

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    clang \
    pkg-config \
    libssl-dev \
    gcc \
    protobuf-compiler

...
```

## Build the Docker image

Build the image named as `lightning` from our Dockerfile:

```sh
sudo docker build -t lightning -f ./Dockerfile .
```

## Docker Container

Create `~/.lightning` configuration directory:

```sh
mkdir $HOME/.lightning
```

Run the lightning-node container:

```sh
sudo docker run \
  -e OPT="in" \
  -p 4200-4299:4200-4299 \
  -p 4300-4399:4300-4399 \
  --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.lightning,target=/home/lgtn/.lightning \
  --mount type=bind,source=/var/tmp,target=/var/tmp \
  --name lightning-node \
  -it lightning
```

:::info
Provide one of the following options "in" or "out" to opt-in or opt-out of network participation, otherwise it'll default to "in". To learn more about network participation control read the section [Lightning CLI Opt](/docs/node/lightning-cli/#opt).
:::

## Generate keys

```sh
sudo docker exec -it lightning-node lgtn keys generate
```

## View logs

To view the logs of a Docker container in real time, use the following command:

```sh
sudo docker logs -f lightning-node
```
