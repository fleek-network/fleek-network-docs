# Fleek Network docs
[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

The Fleek Network documentation and guides source.

### 🤖 Installation

```
yarn
```

### 🏠 Local Development

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### 👷 Build

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### 🕸 Crawler

Crawls are handled by the Algolia [Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/products/search-and-discovery/crawler/) and are scheduled to run once a week by default. You can then trigger new crawls yourself and monitor them directly from the Crawler interface, which also offers a live editor where you can maintain your config.

For this reason, crawling on CI deployment is disabled and can be enabled if moved from docsearch open-source license to a paid account.

### 🚀 Deployment

The documentation site is the static output result of the build command (as directory `build`).

A Github workflow is set up to build and publish to `gh_pages`, which when committed to `gh_pages`, the [pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/fleek-network/fleek-network-docs/actions) triggers.

Any new commit into the `main` branch will trigger the [Deploy (Github pages)](https://github.com/fleek-network/fleek-network-docs/actions/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml) action. For this reason, to publish a new build all you have to do is to commit to `main` branch.

Alternatively, to publish manually to `gh_pages` use the `deploy` command. Here we prefix the command with the optional variables.

```sh
USE_SSH=true GIT_USER=<Your github username> yarn deploy
```

💡 The command requires you to have Git authenticated via ssh.

### 🕸 Web Crawl

⚠️ The `crawl:docker` will not work for now as we moved to the open source version of Algolia called Docsearch and the Crawler has to be triggered manually through their dashboard or awaited for the scheduled job. If preferred to use the `crawl:docker` in the CI, a paid subscription is required.

To trigger manually read [here](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/manage-your-crawls/#trigger-a-new-crawl)

#### CLI version, requires a paid subscription

The web crawler or spider is used to search and automatically index website content. The process can run periodically by docsearch but if you much prefer you can run it manually.

You can run a crawl from the packaged Docker image to crawl your website.

You'll need to have installed:
- jq (command-line JSON processor)
- Docker

Also, have a dotenv (.env) with the following:

```sh
APPLICATION_ID=<YOUR APP ID>
API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
```


Then you need to start the crawl according to your configuration.

```
yarn crawl:docker
```

### 👩‍🎨 Custom domain

A custom domain (cloudflare) is setup to point to github pages as `docs.fleek.network`.

The `docusaurus.config.js` and `config.docsearch.json` are set to use the custom domain. There's another file to persist the custom name for github pages, the `static.CNAME` that should contain the `docs.fleek.network` custom domain.

This is important as otherwise, the DNS checkup would fail!

### 📖 Version
